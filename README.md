# interface_assessments
This package would not be possible without the amazing contributions from the open-source project [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Please check them out and support.

Run the respective executable

`./interface_assessments/godot/trajectory_following/export/trajectory_following.x86_64`

Run ros related interfaces (Need to setup ros environment properly, see README.md in ros folder too):

`roscore`

`rosrun joy joy_node`

`rosun interface_assessment trajectory_following.py`


If you have questions regarding the Godot implementation or communication between ros and Godot, please email Michael at michaelyoung.aero AT gmail DOT com.

If you have questions regarding the logic behind the interfaces or assessments, please email Mahdieh at m.nejati AT u.northwestern DOT edu.
